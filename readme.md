Paint Rental System Backend
This project was developed as a final term project for the Database Systems course (CSE34) and it was developed using Oracle SQL and Database Management skills. The main objective of this project was to design and develop an efficient database backend for a paint rental system.

Features
Multiple cursors for optimized database queries
Triggers for automating specific tasks
Over 10 stored procedures for added functionality
Integration
The backend is integrated with a wireframe website that brings the case study to life as a functional paint rental system. This project allows you to showcase your abilities in both database development and website integration.
